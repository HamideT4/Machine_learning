** Hello**

This repository contains exercises that cover the concepts of linear regression, logistic regression and PCA with scikit-learn.

The "Regression_lin√©aire .ipynb" file uses data from the "data.xlsx" file to implement linear regression with scikit-learn.
The "Regression_Logistique.ipynb" file uses "diabetes.csv" and PCA.ipynb uses the "Data.csv" file.
